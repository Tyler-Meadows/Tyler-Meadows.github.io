    "## MTHE 224 Lab 1: An Introduction to Python3 and Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "### Section 1: Using Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks are organized into cells. Each cell contains either chunks of code&mdash;in our case this means Python 3 code, although you can use Jupyter with other programming languages as well&mdash;or miniature documents written with the word processing language markdown. In order to alternate between cell types, click on box at the bottom right of the cell that says \"Python 3\" or \"Markdown\". There should be a big list of options, but we will only use the Python and Markdown options.\n",
    "\n",
    "To execute code in the selected block, you can either click the \"run by line\" button that appears on the top right of the cell, or you can use the keyboard shortcut `shift+enter`. Executing code works for all cell types. When executing a markdown cell, your markdown code will be converted to a typeset html document. Executing a cell of python code will run all the commands writtin in that cell, saving whatever variables you have defined. The python kernel remembers those variable assignments so you can call on them in subsequent cells. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Section 2: The Markdown environment\n",
    "Markdown is different from other word processing programs, such as microsoft word, in that you are essentially 'coding' the document that you are writing. There are some benfits to this, and some drawback. One obvious drawback is that you don't see how the document looks as you are writing it, which can be a difficult adjustment. A large benfit though, is that you have much more control over formatting, and mathematical equations are much easier to input. You can double click on this section to see an example of what markdown code looks like, compared to the final product. For more information about markdown, see [this webpage,](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics) made by the creator of markdown. I recommend you bookmark that page as a reference. \n",
    "\n",
    "In some of your lab submissions, you may be asked to provide some mathematical explanations of your work. To render mathematical formulas, simply surround them with dollar signs, for example $e^{i\\pi} = 1.$ For longer equations, use two dollar signs on each side of your mathematical formula and the equation will get its own line. For example: $$1 = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma}}e^{\\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}}dx.$$ Mathematical formula are input according to standard Latex commands, which can be found [here.](http://tug.ctan.org/info/undergradmath/undergradmath.pdf\") I recommend you save this pdf as a reference. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Section 3: Basics of Python3\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike C++, which you may have used as part of a previous course, Python is an interpreted programming language. This means that you don't have to recompile the code everytime you make a change. You are able to execute individual lines of code, one at a time, and see what happens. There are some obvious advantages to this: For one thing, it lets you try out things as you go, and if you find that your code is not doing what you expected, you can make changes quickly to see what the outcomes are. The trade-off is that when you go to run your code, it executes more slowly than a compiled language like C++. For what we want to do in this course, the loss of speed will not be noticable. For more advanced programming endeavours, like machine learning, fluid dynamics simulations, or financial applications, the speed difference can be very noticable. If you're interested, there are some programming languages (like [Julia](www.Julialang.org)) that cover a middle ground using something called \"just-in-time\" (jit) compilation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The remainder of this lab will be focused on getting to know the basics of how to use Python3. In the statistics portion of this course, we will be using python to sort, interpret, plot, and summarize data, as well as generate random numbers and simulate experiments to generate our own data. In order to do any of this, we have to first learn what commands python understands, and what the results of those commands will be.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The 'print' command\n",
    "The first program most people write is a \"hello world\" program, in which you simply have the language return the words \"hello world\" when the program is run. In python 'print' is a function that will output whatever the function input is. In general, to print out words, they must be surrounded by quotation marks to tell python that the words are not variables. See a simple example below"

Then whenever we want to use one of the functions associated with `numpy` we have to precede the command with `numpy`. For example to make an arrray we use the function `numpy.array`, and nested square brackets, each row of the array is contained in the inner nest of square brackets.\n",

    "##### Constructing arrays more efficiently. \n",
    "The whole point of using a computer to do calculations for us is to make our lives easier. So what we don't usually want to do is manually input numbers into a matrix. We did that above with the numbers from 1 to 9, and that was tough enough. When we're making numbers than follow some pattern like this, we want a way to do it programmatically. For sequences that follow a simple pattern like the numbers from 1 to 9, we can make use of the `range` function. I.e. to return the numbers from 1 to 9 we would type `range(1,10)`. If we want something a little more complicated, say the even numbers from 0 to 20, we could write `range(0,21,2)`, which read as \"From 0 to 21 by 2\". Note that `range` excludes the last number of the range by default."

    "#### Special Matrix constructions\n",
    "\n",
    "Numpy comes with some methods for making certain types of matrices. For example if we want to make a diagonal matrix, we would rather not have to specify that all of the non-diagonal elements are zero. Here are some examples:\n",
    "- To make a diagonal matrix from a list of values A, use  `np.diag(A)`\n",
    "- To make the $n\\times n$ identity matrix, use `np.eye(n)`\n",
    "- To make an $n\\times m$ matrix of all zeros, use `np.zeros([n,m])`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Loops and Conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most powerful things about programming is the ability to repeat a set procedure a lot of times very quickly. With python (and most programming languages) we do this either with for-loops or while-loops. When creating a loop, we typically have a value or values that we want to change at each subsequent step in the loop. The list of these values is called an <i>iterator</i>. To write a for-loop in Python, we start with a line in the form `for x in list:`, where `x` is what we'll use to refer to the elements in the list later. Python groups commands based on spacing, so everything that we want to be repeated as part of the loop needs to be indented the same number of spaces (or tabs). \n",
    "\n",
    "We often want to change the instructions based on some conditions about the value of the list. to do that we can use if-statements. To write an if-statement in Python, we start with a line in the form `if condition:` where `condition` is some Boolean statement (a Boolean statement is just something that python evaluates to either true or false. For example 1==2 is a Boolean statement that returns `false`). Everything grouped after this statement will be evaluated if the condition is true. To add instructions for what to do if the condition is false, we can include an else-statement after the if-statement's instructions. Else statements can add further conditions if we want by using and elseif-statement in the form `elseif condition:`.\n",
    "\n",
    "While-loops can be written in the form `while condition:` followed by a block of code that will be repeated until the condition is evaluated as `false`. <b> While-loops can be risky.</b> If you aren't careful to write your code to guarantee that the condition is eventually false, the code will run forever. Typically we only want to use while-loops if we're sure that the condition will eventually be false, but we're not sure how many steps it will take to get there. In general, if you can figure out a way to write a for-loop instead, it's better to do it that way. \n",
