                <div class = "lecture">
                    <p>As we saw in the previous lecture, there are some simple experiments that have equally likely outcomes. In these experiments, 
                    determining the probability of an event amounts to counting all the outcomes that are part of that event. 
                    This is a simple enough thing to do when there are few outcomes, but as the number of outcomes increases, we will want to count 
                    more efficiently. Techniques for counting efficiently and effectively belong to a part area of mathematics known as combinatorics.</p>
                    
                    <p><b>The multiplication principle:</b> Sometimes the outcome of an experiment can be thought of as a sequence of outcomes of smaller experiments called trials.
                    In these cases, the number of outcomes for the experiment is the product of the number of outcomes for each trial.</p>
                    <p> For example, consider an experiment where we flip a coin 3 times. How many outcomes are possible? We can spend some time writing out all the different outcomes, $\{T,T,T\},\{T,T,H\},$ and so on.
                        Or we can use the multiplication principle and note that there are three trials, with two outcomes each. So the number of outcomes must be $2\cdot 2 \cdot 2 = 2^3 = 8$. </p>
                    <p><b>Problem:</b> Four coloured balls are placed in a bag and are pulled out one at a time. How many ways are there to pick out all 4 balls?</p>
                    <button onclick="showSolution('prob1')"><b>Solution:</b> (click to show)</button>
                    <div id="prob1" style="display: none;">
                    <p>
                        There are four possible outcomes for picking out the first ball. Once that ball is removed, there are three possible choices for the second ball, then two choices for the third ball, and once choice for the final ball. Therefore 
                        there are $4\cdot 3\cdot 2 \cdot 1 = 24$ possible ways to pick out all 4 balls.
                    </p>
                    </div>
                    <p> The number of ways to select the 4 balls in the last problem can also be thought of as the number of ways that we can put all 4 balls in order. 
                        In fact, this is how we can define the concept of a "factorial". 
                    </p>
                    <p><b>Definition</b> For any non-negative integer $n\in\mathbb{N}$, $n$ factorial (written $n!$) is the number of ways to arrange the $n$ objects.
                    We can compute $n!$ by following the recursion relation:
                    <ol class="roman">
                        <li> $0! = 1$.</li>
                        <li> $n! = n \cdot (n-1)!$ if $n\ne 0$.</li>
                    </ol>
                    For example, $$3! = 3\cdot 2! = 3\cdot 2 \cdot 1! = 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 \cdot 0! = 6$$
                    </p>

                    <p> <b> Example:</b> Lotto 649 is played by picking 6 different numbers between 1 and 49. How many 
                    possible outcomes are there? What is the probability of picking all 6 numbers correctly?</p>
                    <button onclick = "showSolution('prob2')"><b>Solution</b> (click to show)</button>
                    <div id="prob2" style="display:none;">
                    <p>
                    <ul class="lecture-list">
                        <li> There are 49 options for the first number, 48 for the second number, and so on. Therefore there are $49\cdot 48\cdot 47\cdot 46\cdot 45 \cdot 44$ $= 10,068,347,520$ ways to choose numbers.</li>
                        <li> To win you must pick all 6 numbers correctly. There are $6! = 720$ ways to arrange the 6 correct numbers, therefore the event that has the 6 correct numbers has 720 elements. Each of the outcomes is equally likely,
                            so the probability of picking all 6 numbers correctly is $\frac{720}{10,068,347,520} = \frac{1}{13,983,816}\approx 7\cdot 10^{-8}$
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    </div>
                    <h2>Pick and Choose:</h2>
                    <p> We could equivalently have asked "how many ways are there to pick 6 numbers from the set of numbers from 1-49?"
                         Suppose we are selecting $k$ elements from a set with $n$ elements. When the order that objects are selected matters, we have $_nP_k = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!}$, which we read as $n$ pick $k$.
                        For the Lotto 649 example, this gives 
                        \begin{align}_{49}P_{6} &= \frac{49!}{(49-6)!}\\
                         &= \frac{49\cdot 48 \cdot ... }{43 \cdot 42 \cdot ...}\\
                         & = 49\cdot 48\cdot 47 \cdot 46 \cdot 45 \cdot 44,
                        \end{align}
                        which we'll recognize as the total number of outcomes in the sample space.
                    </p>
                    <p> When the order that the objects are selected doesn't matter, some of the outcomes are in a sense equivalent, and we would be over counting 
                        if we used $_n P_k$ by $k!$. We define $_n C _k = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!k!} = \frac{_nP_k}{k!}$, which we read as $n$ choose $k$. In the lotto 649 example,
                        we have \begin{align} 
                        _{49}C_6 & = \frac{49!}{(49-6)!\cdot 6!}\\
                        & = \frac{49\cdot 48 \cdot 47 \cdot ...}{(43 \cdot 42 \cdot ...)(6 \cdot 5 \cdot... )}\\
                        &= \frac{49 \cdot 48 \cdot 47 \cdot 46 \cdot 45 \cdot 44}{720}\\
                        &= 13,983,816.
                        \end{align}
                        This number is the number of choices available. We could have also defined each of these choices as an outcome, rather than defining the outcomes with the order 
                        accounted for. In this case, each outcome is still equally likely and the probability of selecting the correct 6 numbers is $\frac{1}{13983,816}$, exactly as we had before.
                    </p>
                <p> <b> Problem:</b> Anna has been sent to the closet to get some lightbulbs. The box she is looking in has 12 bulbs. Six of these are 60W bulbs, four are 75W,
                     and two are 100W. If Anna picks two bulbs at random, what is the probability that she chooses:
                    <ol class="roman">
                        <li> Two 100W bulbs?</li>
                        <li> Two 75W bulbs?</li>
                        <li> One 75W bulb and one 60W bulb?</li>

                    <div id = "prob3" style="display: none;">
                    <p> The order that the lightbulbs are selected doesn't matter. There are $_{12} C _2 = \frac{12!}{10!2!} =  66$ ways to select 2 lightbulbs. This means there are 66 outcomes in the 
                        sample space.
                        <ol class="roman">
                            <li> Exactly one of these events corresponds to selecting both 100W light bulbs. So the probability of picking both 100W lightbulbs is $\frac{1}{66}$. </li>
                            <li> There are four 75 watt bulbs, and $_4C_2 = 6$ ways to select 2 light bulbs from this group of four. Therefore the probability of selecting both bulbs is $\frac{6}{66} = \frac{1}{11}$.</li>
                            <li> There are four 75W bulbs and six 60W bulbs. By the multiplication principle, there are $4\cdot 6 = 24$ ways to select one 60W bulb and one 75W bulb. Therefore the probability is $\frac{24}{66} = \frac{4}{11}$ </li>
