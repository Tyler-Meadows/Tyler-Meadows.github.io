                    Statistics is the systematic study of how to analyze data. As civil Engineers,
                    you may need to collect data related to material strengths, water flow rates,
                    wind speeds in the area of a build, load on a structure such as a bridge, etc. The
                    data you collect about these things will always vary a little bit. In the case of someting like material
                    strengths, the variations may be small, while in the case of something like wind speeds
                    the variations could be very large. It is important for you to be able to look at 
                    the data that you collect and be able to understand it well enough to determine
                    what to expect from your projects.
                   </p>

                   <p>
                    Statistics can be broadly split into two parts: descriptive statistics and inferential statistics.
                    As the name suggests, descriptive statistics is concerned with how the describe data. 
                    This includes being able to summarize the data using a few helpful measures, such as describing
                    the center and spread of the data set. This also includes being able to determine the appropriate
                    way to present the data set. We will spend some time talking about descriptive statistics in the
                    lab portion of the course, but not much in lectures beyond today.
                   </p>

                   <p>
                    Inferential statisics is more involved, and potentially more interesting. The ideas involved here 
                    center around trying to learn about a complete data set by looking at only a portion (a <i>sample</i>)
                    of the data. Inevitably, this involves using a lot of probability theory, which we will spend a lot of the
                    next 5-6 weeks learning about.
                   </p>

                    Example:
                   </h4>

                   <p> Consider the following set of data. For each of the following 6 questions: 
                    determine whether the question is one that falls into the category of "descriptive statistics" or "inferential statistics".
                    Try to come up with an answer for the descriptive statistics questions.
