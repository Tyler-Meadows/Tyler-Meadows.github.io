                    <p> Sometimes, we may have some additional information about the outcomes of an experiment, which could allow us to restrict
                        the set of possible outcomes. For a simple example, if you know the outcome of a roll of the dice is an even number, you can 
                        remove the odd numbers from the list of possibilities. This additional information changes what the sample space under consideration is and 
                        reduces the number of possibilityes. The new probabilities that take into account the additional information are called <i>conditional probabilities.</i>
                    </p>
                    <p><b> Definition:</b> Suppose $A$ and $B$ are events with $P(B) \ne 0$. The probability of $A$ conditioned on $B$ is 
                    $$P(A|B) = \frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)}.$$ We can also read this as 'The probability of $A$ given $B$.'
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once we know that the event $B$ has occured, the sample space (which is the space of all
                        possible outcomes) collapses from $\mathcal{S}$ to $B$. So the probability of $A$ in the new 
                        sample space can be thought of as the 'size' of $A$ relative to the size of $B$. 
                    </p>
                    <p><b>Example:</b>
                        You roll two six sided dice. If the sum of the two numbers is 6, what is the probability that one of the dice 
                        rolled was a 2?

                    <div id = "prob1" style = "display: none;">
                        <p> Recall that there are 36 possible outcomes for rolling two dice. There are 5 outcomes that lead to a sum of 6: $E_{sum6} = \{(1,5),(2,4),(3,3),(4,2),(5,1)\}$. Two of these outcomes include a 2:
                            $E_2\cap E_{sum6} = \{(2,4),(4,2)\}$. Therefore 
                            \begin{align}
                            P(E_2 | E_{sum6}) &= \frac{P(E_2 \cap E_{sum6})}{P(E_{sum6})}\\
                             &= \frac{\frac{2}{36}}{\frac{5}{36}}\\ 
                             &= \frac{2}{5}
                            \end{align}

                    <p> <b>Definition:</b> A <u>partition</u> of a set $\mathcal{S}$ is a collection of subsets of $\mathcal{S}$,  $E_1,...,E_n$ that are mutually disjoint ($E_i \cap E_j = \varnothing$ if $i\ne j$) and satisfy 
                    $$E_1 \cup E_2 \cup ... \cup E_n = \mathcal{S}.$$
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    For example, if $\mathcal{S} = \{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$ then the sets $E_{odd} = \{1,3,5\}$ and $E_{even} = \{2,4,6\}$ are a partition of $\mathcal{S}$.
                    </p>
                    <p><b> The Law of Total Probability:</b> If $\mathcal{S}$ is a sample space and $E_1,...,E_n$ is a partition of $S$, then for any event $A$ we have

                    </p>
                    <p><b> Example:</b> Billy is a building inspector. During August he inspected 30 residential buildings, 20 commercial buildings and 10 industrial buildings. 5 residential buildings had code violations, 2 commercial buildings had code violations, and 3 industrial buildings had code violations. If Billy follows up with one of the damaged buildings at random, what is the probability that building is a commercial property?</p>

                    <div id = "sol2" style="display: none
                    ;">
                    <p> Our sample space in this problem is to 60 buildings that Billy visited over the month of August. Let $E_V$ be the event that a building has a code violation, $E_C$ be the event that a building is a commercial property, $E_R$ the event it is a residential property, and $E_I$ be the even it is an industrial property. The events $E_C,E_R,$ and $E_I$ are a partition of the sample space. 
                        \begin{align}
                        P(E_V) &= P(E_V|E_C)P(E_C)+P(E_V|E_R)P(E_R)+P(E_V|E_I)P(E_I)\\
                            &= \frac{2}{20}\frac{20}{60} + \frac{5}{30}\frac{30}{60}+\frac{3}{10}\frac{10}{60}\\

                        \end{align}
                    Therefore the probability that it was a commercial building, given there was a code violation is 
                    \begin{align} 
                    P(E_C|E_V) &= \frac{P(E_V\cap E_C)}{E_V}\\
                     & = \frac{\frac{2}{60}}{\frac{1}{6}}\\

                    It's often not easy to calculate $P(A\cap B)$. In fact, in some cases it may be easy to calculate the conditional probability $P(A|B)$ by examining the sets. In the previous example, it was easy to see $P(E_V|E_C)=2/20$, however $P(E_V\cap E_C)$ and $P(E_C|E_V)$ were not as obvious. Fortunately, there is a way to manipulate conditional probabilities so we only have to calculate the easiest versions of them.

                    <p><b> Bayes' Theorem:</b> Suppose $A$ and $B$ are events with $P(B) \ne 0$. Then 
                        $$P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}.$$

                    <b>Example:</b> Suppose I have three unmarked boxes. Each box has two coins in it. In one box, there are two loonies, in the next box there is one loonie and one toonie, and in the final box there are two toonies. Suppose you choose a coin at random from one of the boxes and it is a toonie. What is the probability the other coin is also a toonie?

                    <button onclick="showSolution('prob3')"><b>Solution:</b> (Available after lecture)</button>
                    <div id = "prob3" style="display:none;">
                    <p>
                        Let's label the boxes $B_{11}$,$B_{12}$ and $B_{22}$, and say the event of picking a toonie is $E_2$ and the event of picking a loonie is $E_1$. To restate the problem, we're trying to determine the probability that we have selected box $B_{22}$ given that we have pulled a toonie out ($E_2$). I.e. we're trying to calculate $P(B_{22}| E_2)$.
                        
                        We can use Bayes' theorem, since it is <i>easier</i> to calculate the probability of picking a toonie given that we've chosen box $B_{22}$. That is $P(E_2 | B_{22}) = 1$. The only difficulty will be calculating $P(E_2)$, which we can do using the law of total probability:
                        \begin{align} P(E_2) &= P(E_2|B_{11})P(B_{11})+P(E_2|B_{12})P(B_{12})+P(E_2|B_{22})P(B_{22})\\ 
                        & = 0 + \frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{1}{3} + 1\frac{1}{3}\\
                        & = \frac{1}{2}
                        \end{align}
                        (<b> Note:</b> This is equivalent to forgetting there were ever boxes in the first place, and finding the probability of picking a toonie out a pile of 6 coins containing 3 loonies and 3 toonies.)<br>
                        Therefore 
                        \begin{align}
                        P(B_{22} |E_2) &= \frac{P(E_2|B_22)P(B_{22})}{P(E_2)}\\
                        &= \frac{1 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{\frac{1}{2}}\\
                        & = \frac{2}{3}.
                        \end{align}
                    </p>
                    </div>
