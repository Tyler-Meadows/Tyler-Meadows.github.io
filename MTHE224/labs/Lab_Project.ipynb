    "#### The Problem\n",
    "Wastewater treatement is an important civil engineering discipline. One major aspect of wastewater treatment is designing treatment facilities so that a majority of the harmful components in wastewater are removed before the treated water is returned to the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "One type of wastewater treatment reactor is called a moving-bed biofilm reactor. These reactors utilize bacteria that have formed biofilms on a bed of beads that are located on the bottom of a treatment tank. The bacteria consume harmful nitrites in the water as part of their regular metabolism, and convert them to less harmful nitrates. Polluted water is input at the top of the tank, diffuses through the bacteria covered beads, and cleaner water is released from bottom of the tank.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concentration of nitrites in the water is described by a complicated system of partial differential equations, which eventually reaches a spatially distributed equilibrium concentration. The equilibrium distribution of nitrite concentration is described by the comparatively simple nonlinear boundary value problem \n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "    D\\frac{d^2C}{dx^2}=  \\frac{mC}{K+C} && C(0) = C^{\\rm{in}},\\quad C'(L) = 0,\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "where $x$ is the depth of the tank with $x=0$ corresponding to the top of the bead bed and $x=L$ corresponding to \n",
    "the bottom of the tank, $C(x)$ is the concentration of nitrites at depth $x$, $D$ is the diffision rate, which describes the speed at which the nitrites spread, $m$ is the maximum rate at which the bacteria can absorb the nitrites, $K$ is called the \"half-saturation concentration\", which is the concentration at which the uptake rate is half of its maximum speed.\n",
    "\n",

    "This equation is a second order nonlinear ode, and has no closed form solution in terms of analytical functions. The tools we have learned in labs so far are not directly useful to find approximate solutions, but there are a few methods that can be used to solve nonlinear boundary values problems that build off of what we have discussed.\n",

    "The remaining tasks in this lab will lead you through one method to find approximate solutions to this differential equation. \n",

    "### The Shooting Method\n",
    "<b>How the method works:</b> \n",
    "Non-linear initial value problems are often solved more easily than boundary-value problems, since can make use of the methods like Euler's method, The Trapezoidal Rule, and scipy's integration functions. Instead of considering the boundary value problem, we consider the related initial-value problem\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "    D\\frac{d^2C}{dx^2} &= \\frac{mC}{K+C} &&C(0) = C^{\\rm{in}},~~ C'(0) = \\gamma.\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "Let $C(t;\\gamma)$ be the solution to this initial value problem with $C'(0) = \\gamma$. The shooting method works by adjusting $\\gamma$ until the end point $C'(L;\\gamma)$ is close to the boundary value at $x = L$. We can think of the boundary condition $C'(L) = 0$ as a target we're shooting at, and $\\gamma$ as the angle that we're aiming. If we take two shots at the target and one shot goes high, while and the other goes low, then we know that we need to aim somewhere in the middle of those two shots. \n",
    "\n",
    "### A Simpler Example\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate, consider the equation for the height of a projectile moving with a constant speed in the $x$ direction that starts on the ground at $x=0$ and lands at $x=10.$ \n",
